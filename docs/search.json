Some of my work asks whether, how and why risk-related decisions change across the life span, to what extent different measures of risk and impulsivity converge, and the extent to which studying brain function and anatomy can help us understand the biological basis of individual differences.\n            \n            \n            To address the various questions motivating my work, I adopt a variety of research methods to collect data, including behavioral experiments, surveys, neuroimaging studies, and virtual reality. I also use a variety of data analysis techniques to derive statistical inferences from the sampled data to the wider population of interest. In the future, I hope to transfer some of these methods and the insights gained from studying decisions under risk to a new application context that is close to my heart and part of my previous training, which is the area of decision making in legal settings, including aspects of delinquency and fear of crime.\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            Positions\n            05/2021 - present: Postdoctoral research assistant, Center for Cognitive and Decision Sciences, University of Basel, Switzerland\n            11/2019 - 04/2021: Postdoctoral research fellow, spanlab, Stanford University, CA, USA\n            07/2018 - 09/2019: Postdoctoral research assistant, Center for Cognitive and Decision Sciences, University of Basel, Switzerland\n            \n            \n            Education\n            09/2014 - 06/2018: PhD Psychology, Center for Cognitive and Decision Sciences, University of Basel, Switzerland\n            10/2012 - 09/2014: MSc Social, Cognitive, and Affective Neuroscience, Free University Berlin, Berlin, Germany\n            09/2011 - 11/2012: MRes Security Science, University College London, UK\n            10/2008 - 11/2009: MSc Crime Science, University College London, UK\n            10/2005 - 08/2008: BSc (Hons) Psychology, Goldsmiths’ College, University of London, UK\n            \n            \n            Grants and awards\n            2024: Steven Karger Prize from the Faculty of Psychology, University of Basel\n            2024: University of Basel Research Fund for Excellent Junior Researchers\n            2023: Open Data Award from the Scientific Research Network On Decision Neuroscience & Aging\n            2023: Cross-Border Education Grant (with Dr. Dorothée Bentz and Prof. Dr. Tara Donker)\n            2019: Early Postdoc.Mobility Grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation\n            2018: University of Basel Research Fund for Excellent Junior Researchers\n            2015: Student Travel Award to attend and present poster at the Scientific Research Network on Decision Neuroscience and Aging conference, Miami, FL.\n            2009: Penny Willow Prize for best MSc dissertation in Crime Science in 2009, Jill Dando Institute for Crime Science, University College London\n            \n            \n            Mentoring and outreach activities\n            2023: Participation in Rendez-vous, organized by Science et Cité and Reatch\n            2022 - 2023: Organization Committee of Methods4Postdocs\n            2022: Organization Committee of BEACON\n            \n            \n            Peer review activities\n            I have written reviews for several journals, including Psychological Science, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Personality Processes and Individual Differences, PLoS One, Psychology and Aging, Scientific Reports, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, Gerontology, Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology, npj Science of Learning, Thinking & Reasoning, Cognitive Psychology, Cognition and Emotion, Psychophysiology, Human Brain Mapping, Developmental Psychology, Frontiers in Psychology, International Journal of Behavioral Development, Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, Journal of Cognitive Psychology, Journal of Gerontology: Psychological Sciences, Value in Health.

The goal is to critically assess the use of novel research methods in psychological and criminological research, equipping students with the skills to synthesize evidence and distill broader empirical patterns, research trends, and holistic insights.

What team will win the Swiss Football League? What party or candidate will clinch the next election? When will the next scientific breakthrough discovery be made, and who wil make it? All too often we imagine ourselves as expert forecasters, and opine to know what will happen in the future. But, despite the lure of the superforecasters, making good forecasts is equally fascinating as it is difficult. What information should a good forecast be based on, versus what are many forecasts actually based on? How should information be integrated versus how is information integrated? What actually is a good forecast, how can we judge its performance? Who is the better forecaster: Man or machine? In this seminar we cover the basic principles and psychology of (successful) prediction and examine how well various prediction techniques work under different conditions.\n            \n            \n            \n            Aim of the course\n            \n            This seminar is aimed at Master students, who will acquire an overview of different forecasting techniques, including judgmental and statistical methods, as well as hybrid forms.

Those focusing on secondary data analysis will leverage established data sets to examine patterns and trends, potentially using advanced analytical methods to explore the influence of technological interventions. Students conducting synthesis research will engage in meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines, synthesizing results to understand broader empirical patterns related to these advanced methodologies.

In secondary data analysis, students will work with established data sets to examine patterns and trends related to risk preference and externalizing behaviors. Meta-analysis projects will provide students with an opportunity to synthesize empirical findings across studies, gaining insights into how risk preferences influence or correlate with externalizing behaviors. Across all approaches, students will gain advanced skills in research methods, critical analysis, and interpretation of findings, contributing to a deeper understanding of risk-related behaviors and their psychological underpinnings.\n              \n              \n            \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n    ",

Negotiations are complex, of course, with outcomes ranging from getting the purchase price down on a new bike, to deciding the future of company employees during a takeover, or ending a hostage situation peacefully and without injury.

Research shows prosocial behavior often increases with age, yet older adults are generally more risk-averse, particularly in uncertain situations. However, little is known about how individual factors (e.g., age, gender) and societal influences (e.g., norms, wealth, hardship) shape these decisions. This project aims to fill these gaps by (1) studying the impact of individual and societal factors on personal risk decisions and their underlying mechanisms, and (2) exploring virtual reality simulations to better assess these behaviors.\n            \n            \n            Delphi-Based Agenda Setting for Extended Reality Research in Clinical and Legal Fields\n            \n            Extended reality (XR), including augmented and virtual reality, is a transformative tool in clinical and legal fields, supporting therapy, training, courtroom simulations, and witness preparation. However, XR research in both domains lacks a unified agenda to address ethical, practical, and methodological challenges. This project uses a Delphi design, engaging stakeholders like researchers and policymakers, to identify and prioritize key research areas and applications, guiding ethical and impactful future advancements.

We will use longitudinal data from the Adolescence Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Our project aims to 1) investigate if we can identify distinct classes of hormone trajectories for three sex hormones, 2) investigate the predictive validity of hormone trajectories for externalizing behaviour, and 3) assess the mediating role of impulsivity considering its central role in externalizing throughout childhood and adolescence.
