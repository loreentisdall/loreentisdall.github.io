Some of my work asks whether, how and why\n            risk-related decisions change across the life span, to what\n            extent different measures of risk and impulsivity converge,\n            and the extent to which studying brain function and anatomy\n            can help us understand the biological basis of individual\n            differences.\n            \n            \n            To address the various questions motivating my work, I adopt\n            a variety of research methods to collect data, including\n            behavioral experiments, surveys, neuroimaging studies, and\n            virtual reality. I also use a variety of data analysis\n            techniques to derive statistical inferences from the sampled\n            data to the wider population of interest.

All too often we imagine ourselves as expert\n            forecasters, and opine to know what will happen in the\n            future. But, despite the lure of the superforecasters,\n            making good forecasts is equally fascinating as it is\n            difficult. What information should a good forecast\n            be based on, versus what are many forecasts\n            actually based on?

Who is the better forecaster: Man or\n            machine? In this seminar we cover the basic principles and\n            psychology of (successful) prediction and examine how well\n            various prediction techniques work under different\n            conditions.\n            \n            \n            \n            Aim of the course\n            \n            This seminar is aimed at Master students, who will acquire\n            an overview of different forecasting techniques, including\n            judgmental and statistical methods, as well as hybrid forms.\n            Weekly sessions will enable students to critically assess\n            the pros, cons and required conditions of different methods,\n            and to quantify their performance. Based on regular\n            programming exercises in R Studio, students will learn to\n            apply the theoretical insights and compute, assess and\n            improve their own forecasts.\n            \n            \n            \n            Background literature\n            Armstrong, J.

What information\n              should a good forecast be based on, versus what\n              are many forecasts actually based on? How\n              should information be integrated versus how\n              is information integrated? What actually\n              is a good forecast, how can we judge its\n              performance? Who is the better forecaster: Man or machine?\n              In this seminar we cover the basic principles and\n              psychology of (successful) prediction and examine how well\n              various prediction techniques work under different\n              conditions.\n              \n              \n              \n              Aim of the course\n              \n              This seminar is aimed at Master students, who will acquire\n              an overview of different forecasting techniques, including\n              judgmental and statistical methods, as well as hybrid\n              forms. Weekly sessions will enable students to critically\n              assess the pros, cons and required conditions of different\n              methods, and to quantify their performance. Based on\n              regular programming exercises in R Studio, students will\n              learn to apply the theoretical insights and compute,\n              assess and improve their own forecasts.\n              \n              \n              \n              Background literature\n              Armstrong, J.

Instead, there may be\n            much more of a science of negotiation, which can\n            help individuals to prepare for, engage in, and close\n            negotiations, and to do so more successfully. Negotiations\n            are complex, of course, with outcomes ranging from getting\n            the purchase price down on a new bike, to deciding the\n            future of company employees during a takeover, or ending a\n            hostage situation peacefully and without injury. By\n            examining negotiations scientifically, we can establish\n            basic principles that hold across different negotiation\n            situations, which in turn allow us to identify factors that\n            influence negotiation processes and outcomes.\n            \n            \n            \n            Aim of the course\n            \n            This seminar is aimed at Master students, who will learn the\n            fundamental principles and concepts underlying negotiation\n            theory and behavioral decision making. Based on concrete\n            role-playing exercises featuring predefined goals, budgets,\n            etc., students will develop and continually improve their\n            negotiation skills, including how to frame, prepare, and\n            conduct different kinds of negotiations.\n            \n            \n            \n            Background literature\n            Raiffa,\n            H.

Instead, there\n              may be much more of a science of negotiation,\n              which can help individuals to prepare for, engage in, and\n              close negotiations, and to do so more successfully.\n              Negotiations are complex, of course, with outcomes ranging\n              from getting the purchase price down on a new bike, to\n              deciding the future of company employees during a\n              takeover, or ending a hostage situation peacefully and\n              without injury. By examining negotiations scientifically,\n              we can establish basic principles that hold across\n              different negotiation situations, which in turn allow us\n              to identify factors that influence negotiation processes\n              and outcomes.\n              \n              \n              \n              Aim of the course\n              \n              This seminar is aimed at Master students, who will learn\n              the fundamental principles and concepts underlying\n              negotiation theory and behavioral decision making.

It analyzes both human\n            and AI-based safety assessments to understand environmental\n            influences on safety perception, creating a unique image\n            database and offering insights for evidence-based urban\n            planning and policy. Key collaborator is Réka Solymosi.\n            \n            \n            Helping at a Cost\n            \n            Prosocial behavior often involves personal risks, such as\n            intervening in harassment or participating in organ\n            donation. Research shows prosocial behavior often increases\n            with age, yet older adults are generally more risk-averse,\n            particularly in uncertain situations. However, little is\n            known about how individual factors (e.g., age, gender) and\n            societal influences (e.g., norms, wealth, hardship) shape\n            these decisions. This project aims to fill these gaps by (1)\n            studying the impact of individual and societal factors on\n            personal risk decisions and their underlying mechanisms, and\n            (2) exploring virtual reality simulations to better assess\n            these behaviors.
