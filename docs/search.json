Some of my work asks whether, how and why risk-related decisions change across the life span, to what extent different measures of risk and impulsivity converge, and the extent to which studying brain function and anatomy can help us understand the biological basis of individual differences.\n            \n            \n            To address the various questions motivating my work, I adopt a variety of research methods to collect data, including behavioral experiments, surveys and neuroimaging studies, and I use a variety of data analysis techniques to derive statistical inferences from the sampled data to the wider population of interest. In the future, I hope to transfer some of these methods and the insights gained from studying decisions under risk to a new application context that is close to my heart and part of my previous training, which is the area of decision making in legal settings, including aspects of delinquency and policing.\n            \n            \n            \n            Positions\n            05/2020 - present: Postdoctoral research assistant, Center for Cognitive and Decision Sciences, University of Basel, Switzerland\n            11/2019 - 04/2021: Postdoctoral research fellow, spanlab, Stanford University, CA, USA\n            07/2018 - 09/2019: Postdoctoral research assistant, Center for Cognitive and Decision Sciences, University of Basel, Switzerland\n            \n            \n            Education\n            09/2014 - 06/2018: PhD Psychology, Center for Cognitive and Decision Sciences, University of Basel, Switzerland\n            10/2012 - 09/2014: MSc Social, Cognitive, and Affective Neuroscience, Free University Berlin, Berlin, Germany\n            09/2011 - 11/2012: MRes Security Science, University College London, UK\n            10/2008 - 11/2009: MSc Crime Science, University College London, UK\n            10/2005 - 08/2008: BSc(Hons) Psychology, Goldsmiths’ College, University of London, UK\n            \n            \n            Grants and awards\n            2023: Open Data Award from the Scientific Research Network On Decision Neuroscience & Aging\n            2023: Cross-Border Education Grant (with Dr. Dorothée Bentz and Prof. Dr. Tara Donker)\n            2019: Early Postdoc.Mobility Grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation\n            2018: Postdoctoral Grant from the University of Basel Research Fund for Excellent Junior Researchers\n            2015: Student travel grant to attend and present poster at the Scientific Research Network on Decision Neuroscience and Aging conference, Miami, FL.\n            2009: Penny Willow Prize for best MSc dissertation in Crime Science in 2009, Jill Dando Institute for Crime Science, University College London\n            \n            \n            Mentoring and outreach activities\n            2023: Participation in Rendez-vous, organized by Science et Cité and Reatch\n            2022 - present: Organization Committee of Methods4Postdocs\n            2022: Organization Committee of BEACON\n            \n            \n            Peer review activities\n            I have written reviews for several journals, including Psychological Science, PLoS One, Psychology and Aging, Scientific Reports, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, Gerontology, Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology, Thinking & Reasoning, Cognitive Psychology, Cognition and Emotion, Psychophysiology, Cognitive Psychology, Frontiers in Psychology, International Journal of Behavioral Development, Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, Journal of Cognitive Psychology, Journal of Gerontology: Psychological Sciences, Value in Health.

The societal and personal costs of (disordered) externalizing, including unemployment, incarceration, addiction, to name but a few, are evidently huge. To intervene and, ideally, prevent externalizing behaviors from negatively affecting individuals and societies alike, we first must understand how to study externalizing and how externalizing relates to other constructs (e.g., impulsivity, risk preference). In a second step, we can try to identify biological (e.g., brain) and behavioral phenotypes that explain and/or predict externalizing.\n            \n            \n            Depending on individual interests and in consultation with me as your primary supervisor, thes bachelor thesis focuses on the topic of individual differences in risk preference and other related externalizing behaviors. You will use systematic research methods for synthesizing the existing research literature, which you will learn during the course of your bachelor thesis.

What team will win the Swiss Football League? What party or candidate will clinch the next election? When will the next scientific breakthrough discovery be made, and who wil make it? All too often we imagine ourselves as expert forecasters, and opine to know what will happen in the future. But, despite the lure of the superforecasters, making good forecasts is equally fascinating as it is difficult. What information should a good forecast be based on, versus what are many forecasts actually based on? How should information be integrated versus how is information integrated? What actually is a good forecast, how can we judge its performance? Who is the better forecaster: Man or machine? In this seminar we cover the basic principles and psychology of (successful) prediction and examine how well various prediction techniques work under different conditions.\n            \n            \n            \n            Aim of the course\n            \n            This seminar is aimed at Master students, who will acquire an overview of different forecasting techniques, including judgmental and statistical methods, as well as hybrid forms. Weekly sessions will enable students to critically assess the pros, cons and required conditions of different methods, and to quantify their performance. Based on regular programming exercises in R Studio, students will learn to apply the theoretical insights and compute, assess and improve their own forecasts.\n            \n            \n            \n            Background literature\n            Armstrong, J.

What team will win the Swiss Football League? What party or candidate will clinch the next election? When will the next scientific breakthrough discovery be made, and who wil make it? All too often we imagine ourselves as expert forecasters, and opine to know what will happen in the future. But, despite the lure of the superforecasters, making good forecasts is equally fascinating as it is difficult. What information should a good forecast be based on, versus what are many forecasts actually based on? How should information be integrated versus how is information integrated? What actually is a good forecast, how can we judge its performance? Who is the better forecaster: Man or machine? In this seminar we cover the basic principles and psychology of (successful) prediction and examine how well various prediction techniques work under different conditions.\n              \n              \n              \n              Aim of the course\n              \n              This seminar is aimed at Master students, who will acquire an overview of different forecasting techniques, including judgmental and statistical methods, as well as hybrid forms. Weekly sessions will enable students to critically assess the pros, cons and required conditions of different methods, and to quantify their performance. Based on regular programming exercises in R Studio, students will learn to apply the theoretical insights and compute, assess and improve their own forecasts.\n              \n              \n              \n              Background literature\n              Armstrong, J.

Please see the CDS webpage for the structure of MSc projects and associated learning opportunities at the Center for Cognitive and Decision Sciences.

The societal and personal costs of (disordered) externalizing, including unemployment, incarceration, addiction, to name but a few, are evidently huge. To intervene and, ideally, prevent externalizing behaviors from negatively affecting individuals and societies alike, we first must understand how to study externalizing and how externalizing relates to other constructs (e.g., impulsivity, risk preference). In a second step, we can try to identify biological (e.g., brain) and behavioral phenotypes that explain and/or predict externalizing.\n            \n            \n            To help us in our endeavor to better study and, ultimately, understand externalizing and its (brain) basis, we are looking for students interested in (pre/sub) clinical disorders, cognitive or affective neuroscience, brain imaging, large-scale human (imaging) studies (e.g., ABCD, Human Connectome Project, UK Biobank) or other related topics. In this Masterprojekt, students have the opportunity to explore a variety of topics and research methods, including how to identify and access data sets of large-scale human (imaging) studies, research synthesis methods (e.g., scoping reviews, systematic reviews, meta-analyses), and secondary data analysis of human imaging and/or behavioral data. Students will also be encouraged to establish connections with practitioners in the field of externalizing disorders via Meet-the-Expert events, journal clubs, and other practically-oriented formats. Interested students are highly welcome to suggest and adopt (assuming feasibility) alternative scientific methodologies and address questions of their own interest.\n            \n            \n            \n            Topic 2: Making negotiations work (for you): A scientific approach to understanding negotiation processes and outcomes\n            \n            The idea that some people are born negotiators who employ the art of negotiation to achieve maximally beneficial results for their own purpose is a pervasive one, yet it is scientifically questionable. Instead, there may be much more of a science of negotiation, which can help individuals to prepare for, engage in, and close negotiations, and to do so more successfully. Negotiations are complex, of course, with outcomes ranging from getting the purchase price down on a new bike, to deciding the future of company employees during a takeover, or ending a hostage situation peacefully and without injury. By examining negotiations scientifically, we can establish basic principles that hold across different negotiation situations, which in turn allow us to identify factors that influence negotiation processes and outcomes.\n            \n            \n            For this project, students adopt a scientific approach to examining one or several of the following (or related) research questions:\n            \n            What are the main stages and processes characteristic of negotiations?\n            Which personal (e.g., cognition, affect, motivation), structural (e.g., culture, power status, number and nature of negotiating parties) and/or situational (e.g., time constraints, repeated interactions) + factors have an influence on negotiation processes and outcomes?\n            What are the implications of influencing factors for optimizing negotiation processes and outcomes? What does optimization in this context mean, and for whom (i.e., for one or all parties involved)?\n            Can we find informative visualizations (e.g., flow chart, process flow diagrams, etc.?) of negotiation processes, influencing variables and outcomes for the purpose of scientific communication?\n            What’s new in negotiation? The emergence of E-Negotiations and how these differ from traditional (in-person) negotiations.\n            For background literature, check out Raiffa, H. E., Richardson, J., & Metcalfe, D. (2007).

Instead, there may be much more of a science of negotiation, which can help individuals to prepare for, engage in, and close negotiations, and to do so more successfully. Negotiations are complex, of course, with outcomes ranging from getting the purchase price down on a new bike, to deciding the future of company employees during a takeover, or ending a hostage situation peacefully and without injury. By examining negotiations scientifically, we can establish basic principles that hold across different negotiation situations, which in turn allow us to identify factors that influence negotiation processes and outcomes.\n              \n              \n              \n              Aim of the course\n              \n              This seminar is aimed at Master students, who will learn the fundamental principles and concepts underlying negotiation theory and behavioral decision making. Based on concrete role-playing exercises featuring predefined goals, budgets, etc., students will develop and continually improve their negotiation skills, including how to frame, prepare, and conduct different kinds of negotiations.\n              \n              \n              \n              Background literature\n              Raiffa, H.

Given that nucleus accumbens functional activity is driven by neurotransmission from connected brain regions, in this project we are investigating whether the structural properties of tracts carrying signals to the nucleus accumbens may also predict risk preference.

A particular focus of this project is to examine the extent to which associations between age and the different constructs differ as a function of whether we use self reports, behavioral measures, informant reports, or neuroimaging to assess risk preference, impulsivity, or self-control.

We were particularly interested in examining common and unique effects of age on the neural correlates of different kinds of uncertainty, namely paradigms of risk and temporal discounting.
