### Research synthesis in the area of crime and delinquency

<p style="text-align:justify;">I am offering Bachelor thesis topics in the area of research synthesis focused on crime, delinquency and victimization. These topics will involve systematically synthesizing existing research that utilizes advanced technologies such as virtual reality and large language models (LLMs). Students will engage in comprehensive literature reviews following PRISMA guidelines, learning to apply these standards for conducting transparent and methodical reviews. The goal is to critically assess the use of novel research methods in psychological and criminological research, equipping students with the skills to synthesize evidence and distill broader empirical patterns, research trends, and holistic insights. For more information about how we structure our supervision at the Center for Cognitive and Decision Sciences, see our dedicated [Bachelor's thesis website](https://matarui.github.io/BSc_thesis/).</p>

### Research synthesis in the area of risk taking, externalizing behavior, and related disorders

<p style="text-align:justify;">I am offering Bachelor thesis topics in the area of individual differences in risk preference and related externalizing behaviors. Students will learn to use systematic research methods for synthesizing the existing research literature following PRISMA guidelines. Depending on interest, related (clinical) phenotypes (e.g., substance addiction, antisocial and criminal behavior) can also be the focus of your research.
