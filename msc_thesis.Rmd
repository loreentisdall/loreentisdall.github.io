### Research in the area of crime and delinquency

<p style="text-align:justify;">I am offering Master’s thesis projects in the areas of crime, delinquency, and victimization, with a potential focus on the use of advanced technologies such as virtual reality and large language models. Students are welcome to explore different research approaches, including: 1) original research, involving the design of a study and collection of primary data; 2) secondary data analysis, utilizing existing data sets to explore relevant research questions; and 3) synthesis research through a meta-analysis to systematically combine findings across multiple studies. For original research, students may design innovative studies that apply technologies like large language models or virtual reality to investigate aspects of criminal behavior or victim experiences. Those focusing on secondary data analysis will leverage established data sets to examine patterns and trends, potentially using advanced analytical methods to explore the influence of technological interventions. Students conducting synthesis research will engage in meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines, synthesizing results to understand broader empirical patterns related to these advanced methodologies. Across all approaches, the goal is to develop students’ critical analysis and research skills, enabling them to contribute valuable insights into the evolving landscape of psychological and criminological research.</p>

### Research in the area of risk taking, externalizing behavior, and related disorders

<p style="text-align:justify;">I am offering Master’s thesis projects in the area of individual differences in risk preference and related externalizing behaviors. Students are welcome to explore different research approaches, including: 1) original research, involving the design of a study and collection of primary data; 2) secondary data analysis, utilizing existing data sets to explore risk preferences and associated behaviors (e.g., ABCD study); or 3) synthesis through a meta-analysis, systematically combining findings from multiple studies using PRISMA guidelines. Research projects can also focus on related clinical phenotypes, such as substance addiction, antisocial behavior, or criminal tendencies. For original research, students might design studies that investigate the psychological and behavioral correlates of risk-taking. In secondary data analysis, students will work with established data sets to examine patterns and trends related to risk preference and externalizing behaviors. Meta-analysis projects will provide students with an opportunity to synthesize empirical findings across studies, gaining insights into how risk preferences influence or correlate with externalizing behaviors. Across all approaches, students will gain advanced skills in research methods, critical analysis, and interpretation of findings, contributing to a deeper understanding of risk-related behaviors and their psychological underpinnings.</p>
